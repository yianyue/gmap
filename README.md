#Google Map API exercise

Using the google map api and javascript/jquery, add markers to a list of places in Toronto.

1. With geocoding, find location information from city name ("Toronto" in this case) and centre the map around the city.

2. Again using geocoding, obtain a list of places with their lat-lng from place names.

3. Add markers to the list of places.

4. Add an overlay to the map display the list of places with checkboxes. 

Unchecking a checkbox removes the place marker from the map.
